The vCard element type definition refers to a schema within a draft RFC. We anticipate that the
final RFC will be identical in the definitions we use here, and when it is finalized we will adjust
the reference. If the final version differs from the draft in a way that is significant to this
specification, then this document will be modified. This document requires this specific version
of the vCard specification. Any subsequent updates of the vCard specification will require this
document to be updated to incorporate it.
