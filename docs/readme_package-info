Package Comment Files

Each package can have its own documentation comment, contained in its own "source"
file, that the Javadoc tool will merge into the package summary page that it
generates. You typically include in this comment any documentation that applies
to the entire package.

To create a package comment file, you have a choice of two files to place your comments:

    package-info.java - Can contain a package declaration, package annotations,
                        package comments and Javadoc tags. This file is new in
                        JDK 5.0, and is preferred over package.html.

    package.html      - Can contain only package comments and Javadoc tags, no package
                        annotations.

A package may have a single package.html file or a single package-info.java file
but not both. Place either file in the package directory in the source tree along
with your .java files.

    package-info.java - This file can contain a package comment of the following
                        structure -- the comment is placed before the package declaration:

File: java/applet/package-info.java

    /**
     * Provides the classes necessary to create an
     * applet and the classes an applet uses
     * to communicate with its applet context.
     * <p>
     * The applet framework involves two entities:
     * the applet and the applet context.
     * An applet is an embeddable window (see the
     * {@link java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra
     * methods that the applet context can use to
     * initialize, start, and stop the applet.
     *
     * @since 1.0
     * @see java.awt
     */
    package java.lang.applet;

Note that while the comment separators /** and /* must be present, the leading
asterisks on the intermediate lines can be omitted.
