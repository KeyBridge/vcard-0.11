#  xCard: The vCard XML Representation

## About
This is a Java compiled implementation of the XML format for vCard (xCard) draft.

Software comports with tje vCard Format Specification draft-ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev-22 
and the vCard XML Representation draft-ietf-vcarddav-vcardxml-11.

The package is formatted and provided as a NetBeans project.

## Alternatives

This project exists to provide a standards-based serializable vCard
implementation. As such we have not spent a tremendous amount of time
extending the basic bean containers with data-handling functionality. 

If you need a comprehensive and fully-functional iCalendar management
scheme then you might have better luck using iCal4j. The iCal4j project
has integrated vCard object support.
